# VibeCheck

VibeCheck is an app for music enthusiasts with synesthesia who want to document and organize individual tracks based on the dominant color they evoke as well as any associated visualizations and emotions. Users will be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete (if only there was a convenient shorthand for this concept) entries, generate data that relates to them as an individual, and never have to navigate away from a single page.
